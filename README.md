# My JavaScript to TypeScript Conversion Repository

This repository demonstrates the process of converting JavaScript code to TypeScript by adding types such as number, string, and boolean without using TypeScript directly. The main goal is to understand how type annotations can be integrated into JavaScript files using JSDoc.

Branches:
- **main**: Stable version of the project.
- **develop**: Development version where new features are tested.
- **feature/js-to-ts**: Feature branch dedicated to converting JavaScript code to TypeScript-style annotations.
